# MSFS folder

My approach to having something similar to kpcrew in MSFS. PMDG and other vendors do not work out the ingame checklists of MSFS to automatically execute procedures. I have read up on the SDK and it is possible to have procedures and checklist to be fairly automated if you wish, My first checklist takes the Zibo kpcrew SOP and I started to transfer it to an ingame checklist.
