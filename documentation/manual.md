# KPCrew 2.2-alpha3 (12/2021)
FlyWithLua scripts to simulate a virtual first officer in X-Plane 11. THIS IS A COMPLETE REWRITE AND STILL IN ALPHA. PLEASE REMOVE ANY OLDER KPCREW FILES FROM SCRIPTS AND MODULES FOLDER!

## Introduction
Coming from the FSX/P3D world I know the FS2Crew products which I had for all payware aircraft if available. I always wished that I could get something like that for X-Plane. FlyWithLua turned out to be a great programming environment for X-Plane and I decided to try replicating something like FS2Crew for the Zibo B738. 

Why the Zibo? Because it is the most accessible and function-rich freeware aircraft in X-Plane and I love the Boeing 737s.

### What does it do? 

Basically you have a helping hand, a virtual first officer which is able to run procedures on your command. These procedures are as close as I can have them to real procedures, partially I get inspiration from FS2Crew (a great tool I would always recommend).

There are other tools out there which do similar things, the most versatile one being XFirstOfficer. I had a KPCrew version with XFirstOfficer but it turned out a lot of work and although quite versatile, restricted me at some locations due to the way the steps are defined. Still XFirstOfficer is great and I can recommend it to people who want to quickly bring together small procedures without programming.

Having said that, KPCrew is one big programming exercise and I can understand that it will be difficult for people without experience in Lua programming to change or extend things. If you want to do that then look at other tools as mentioned above.

### Other aircraft supported?

Will there be other aircraft? Yes, it will also contain the FJS B737-200 and many other planes if I have the addon and find the time to research it.

### History of KPCrew
KPCrew went through several iterations, initially I called it Zibocrew. The initial concept was clunky and inflexible. I think I now have a good enough concept to easily extend the scripts. I even have now background events. As it is with Lua, you can see all that I did but when you change code you are on your own â€“ I will not have the time to support this or hold hands with the installation. This is one of the reasons why I hesitated to release this publicly.

## Changes
TBD

## Installation
### The KPCrew-x.x.x.zip File
KPCrew comes in a Zip-file and needs to be manually installed under your X-Plane-11 folder. The ZIP contains the following folders:
- kpcrew
  - aircraft  --> contains aircraft specific files such as Flows or Honeycomb profiles
  - documentation  --> documentation for KPCrew
  - modules  --> files to go in the FlyWithlua module folder; all the KPCrew and aircraft modules
  - scripts  -->  files to go in the FlyWithlua module folder; the main lua script
  - readme.md  --> a readme file
  - LICENSE  --> the license terms

### How to install
Modules and Scripts are FlyWithLua specific folders. Find them  here:

- Your X-Plane-11 Root Folder
  - Resources
    - plugins
      - FlyWithLua
        - scripts  --> put kpcrew2.lua here (overwrite older versions)
        - modules  --> put all lua files in modules folder here

**Make sure that you removed any older files from previous versions of KPCrew (2, 2,.1 and 1.x also called Zibocrew)**

### How to uninstall
Simply remove all the above lua files from the **scripts** and **modules** folder.
