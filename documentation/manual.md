# KPCrew 2.3-alpha3 (10/2022)
FlyWithLua scripts to simulate a virtual first officer in X-Plane 11. 
THIS IS A COMPLETE REWRITE AND STILL IN ALPHA. PLEASE REMOVE ANY OLDER KPCREW FILES FROM SCRIPTS AND MODULES FOLDER!

## Introduction
Coming from the FSX/P3D world I know the FS2Crew products which I had for all payware aircraft if available. I always wished that I could get something like that for X-Plane. FlyWithLua turned out to be a great programming environment for X-Plane and I decided to try replicating something like FS2Crew for the Zibo B738. 

Why the Zibo? Because it is the most accessible and function-rich freeware aircraft in X-Plane and I love the Boeing 737s.

### What does it do? 

Basically you have a helping hand, a virtual first officer which is able to run procedures on your command. These procedures are as close as I can have them to real procedures, partially I get inspiration from FS2Crew (a great tool I would always recommend).

There are other tools out there which do similar things, the most versatile one being XFirstOfficer. I had a KPCrew version with XFirstOfficer but it turned out a lot of work and although quite versatile, restricted me at some locations due to the way the steps are defined. Still XFirstOfficer is great and I can recommend it to people who want to quickly bring together small procedures without programming.

Having said that, KPCrew is one big programming exercise and I can understand that it will be difficult for people without experience in Lua programming to change or extend things. If you want to do that then look at other tools as mentioned above.

### Other Aircraft Supported?

Will there be other aircraft? Yes, it will also contain the FJS B737-200 and many other planes if I have the addon and find the time to research it.

### History of KPCrew
KPCrew went through several iterations, initially I called it Zibocrew. The initial concept was clunky and inflexible. I think I now have a good enough concept to easily extend the scripts. I even have now background events. As it is with Lua, you can see all that I did but when you change code you are on your own â€“ I will not have the time to support this or hold hands with the installation. This is one of the reasons why I hesitated to release this publicly.

### Code from other developers used in KPCrew:
 - xml2lua (https://github.com/manoelcampos/xml2lua) from manoelcampus to read the simbrief XML
 - metar (https://github.com/tjormola/metar) from tjormola which I have changed slightly to embedd it and improve the parsing
 - weatherlib (https://github.com/tjormola/weatherlib) needed by metar.lua

### Startup
Once you have installed the lua files in the correct places, next time your X-Plane starts it will also automatically start KPCrew. If you have loaded one of the supported aircraft add-ons (currently the Zibo Mod B738) you can call up the control window on the bottom right of the X-Plane window. Either use a custom key/button with command "_kp/crew/openmaster_" called "_KPCrew Open Master Window_" or find the Macro "_KPCrew Toggle Control Window_".

![Control Window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prokopiu/kpcrew/kpcrew23/documentation/images/controlwindow.png)

### The Control Window

These are the elements of the Control Window:

 - **[SOP]**: Opens the Standard Operating Procedure window with all associated flows
 - **[FLOW]**: Opens the currently selected flow (Procedure or Checklist)
 - **[<-]**: Select previous item
 - **[FLOW WINDOW]**: Information where in the flow you are and the status of the flow item. Click to execute master button.
 - **[->]**: Select next item. Can also be used to skip flows and flow items
 - **[RESET]**: Resets the currently selected flow
 - **[BRIEF]**: Shows the flight briefing window to provide information to KPCrew
 - **[PREF]**: Shows the preferences to set for KPCrew
 - **[>]**: Minimize the control window (master window)
	
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Listing and Selecting Flows

Each supported aircraft has an SOP defined which can be looked at by opening the SOP window.

![SOP Window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prokopiu/kpcrew/kpcrew23/documentation/images/sopwindow.PNG)

By double-clicking on a line, you select the respective flow. It should show in the control window. You can also use the [<-] and [->] button in the control window to move through flows. Red means the flow selected or the cursor over it, green means the flow was executed in an automatic mode and is finished. Dark green background mark procedures, black background are checklists. There are slightly different rules with checklists and procedures.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### The Flow Window

Each procedure or Checklist can be displayed in the Flow Window.

![FLOW Window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prokopiu/kpcrew/kpcrew23/documentation/images/flowindow.PNG)

When opened for the first time in a session, you can immediately see which items are OK and which items you need to check/attend to. The open items are in RED. All the other lines in white.
White lines are comments/instructions or anything not part of an automated flow.
If you use any of the automated modes and let a procedure/checklist be run, all correct items will be colored green when executed. Outstanding items are grey or red. Incorrect items stay red and the flow will stop.
In this example DC POWER SWITCH is the next item to attend to and it is not correctly set.
You can reset the displayed flow by pressing on the RESET button. The flow can then be restarted again.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Preferences Window

You can set a number of KPCrew preferences which will apply to all aircraft modules and some aircraft specific preferences which depend on the selected aircraft.
For this you can open the PREFERENCES window:

![PREFERENCES window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prokopiu/kpcrew/kpcrew23/documentation/images/preferenceswindow.PNG)

The **v GENERAL PREFERENCES** section applies to the application in general, Below you will see a **v [ICAO] PREFERENCES** which covers the selected aircraft. Click on it to open.


Since Markdown accepts plain HTML and CSS, simply add this line wherever you want to force page break.

#### GENERAL PREFERENCES

 - **Assistance Level**:  [No assistance][Guided][Some automation][Fully automatic]
   - **_No assistance_**: To execute on a flow will only open the flow window and show the procedure/checklist with all open items in red, otherwise in grey.
   - **_Guided_**: When starting the flow with the Master button, it will go through all items and stop at red ones waiting for you to fix the item. You can skip it with the Next button [->].
   - **_Some automation_**: When starting the flow with the Master button, it will go through all items and execute logic (if available) if it is not one of your tasks (your role being CPT, PF,...). Items that are your responsibility still need to be fixed by yourself.
   - **_Fully automatic_**: When starting the flow with the Master button, it will go through all items and execute logic (if available). Ideally you will not have to intervene in this mode and can concentrate on other things. Note, checklists still need your intervention - the other role speaks the challenge and you have to check and answer.
 - **Weight Units**: [KGS / LBS] Displays and treats all weights either as KG or LBS
 - **EFIS Default Baro Mode(Both)**: [HPA / IN] Sets the default mode on the EFIS to either HPA (mb) or IN (inchHg)
 - **Default Transition Altitude (ft)**: Set the transition altitude default. Use the TALT of the region your are flying in mostly
 - **Default Transition Level (FL)**: Set the transition level default. Use the TLVL of the region your are flying in mostly
 - **Speak Checklists**: (deprecated) Speak either all sides of the checklist (will be disabled in next release) or only challenge.
 - **Flow window on start**: When you start a flow with the master button you can force the Flow window to open. Default is not to open windows.
 - **Flow window at end**: At the end of a flow you can automatically close the Flow window or leave it open to deal with it yourself.
 - **On end of Flow**: At the end of a flow you can jump to the next flow to avoid you having to call up each flow manually. If you want to be in control then use _Do not jump option_.
 - **Transponder**: In USA mode it will turn on the transponder at beginning of taxi and at the end with shutdown mode. In EUR mode it will turn on XDPR when entering runway and when exiting the runway in cleanup mode.
 - **SIMBRIEF Username**: enter your username so that KPCrew can pull your latest filed OFP
 - **VATSIM METAR**: When you turn Load ON then KPCrew will load the VATSIM METARs from airports in your flight briefing every couple of minutes. If you turn this option off KPCrew will generate some METAR based on the local weather. When you have Real Weather Download on in X-Plane, it wil lonly display the local METAR for your origin. Otherwise the same METAR applies to destination and alternate airport.

#### AIRCRAFT SPECIFIC PREFERENCES

Every supported aircraft will have a set of settings which are unique to it. Here you can see samples for the DFLT module (default aircraft from Laminar) or the Zibo Mod preferences.

### LOAD/SAVE Preferences

Your preferences can be saved and then reloaded with the next start of the simulator or the FlyWithLua plugin. KPCrew will initialize the name field with the ICAO code of the loaded aircraft (or DFLT if not supported).
Preferences are currently saved individually with every aircraft. You may have to set them again when loading a new aircraft. 
You can use any name in the name field and save current preferences.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Briefings

One important component of KPCrew is to provide as much as possible information about the flight you are planning. This not only helps you but also helps KPCrew to improve the automation of procedures and checklists.

### BRIEFINGS Window

![PREFERENCES window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prokopiu/kpcrew/kpcrew23/documentation/images/briefings.PNG)

There are many sections you can open and provide information. You can open and close them as needed. AT the bottom of the window you can save the current state of you briefings under any name. The file will be written to your kpcrew_prefs folder in FlyWithLua.

![PREFERENCES window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prokopiu/kpcrew/kpcrew23/documentation/images/loadsavebrief.PNG)

#### INFORMATION section

This section is always open and provides many information about the current session. The loaded aircraft, weights, current position in coordinates that can also be used in CIVA INS, METARs for all selected airports and a flight time recorder.
Flight times are: 
 - OFF: off block time (triggered by pushback/startup procedure). 
 - OUT: takeoff time triggered by takeoff procedure
 - IN: landing time (triggered by after landing / cleanup)
 - ON: on blocks time (triggered by shutdown procedure)
 
#### FLIGHT section

![PREFERENCES window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prokopiu/kpcrew/kpcrew23/documentation/images/briefflight.PNG)

 - **Simbrief Data Load**: If you have filed a flight with Simbrief.com and provided a username in preferences then many fields in the following sections will be filled by what you have in your OFP. Italis fields can be filled from Simbrief.
 - **_ATC Callsign:_** Callsign that you filed with ATC (VATSIM/ICAO...)
 - **_Origin ICAO:_** ICAO code of origin airport
 - **_Destinaton ICAO:_** ICAO code of destination airport
 - **_Alternate ICAO:_** ICAO code of alternate airport
 - **_Route:_** optional route from Simbrief
