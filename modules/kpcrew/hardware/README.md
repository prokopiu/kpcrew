# hardware folder

This folder will contain hardware specific modules to use with KPHARDWARE. At the moment it only contains the Honeycomb devices.
There are two profiles to be used with the AFC Bridge and special lua files that execute commands matching the Honeycomb devices.

Optional if you want to use this.
